# Falling Palms
 Working title for my webGL game 
 
## Story
The player is a woman that has been punched into the sky by some gangsters. To 
surivive, she must first stop herself in midair before she hits the ground.
After centering herself, she must eliminate the gangsters before they kill her
with projectile metal thorns.

## Gameplay 
- Phase 1 
To stop the woman from falling, the player has to click on the wind stream 
particles that are passing by. This will make them stationary. If the player 
cannot do it before she hits the ground, she dies. While trying to click on 
the air stream particles with the palm, the player can also maneuver in midair.
Th player must use this movement to dodge the thorns. 
If they are hit, a random frozen air stream particle will move again. This will 
set her back.
- Phase 2 
Once she is centered, the player can use her buddha palms to eliminate the 
gangsters. She can also maneuver in air.
